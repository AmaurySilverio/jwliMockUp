				<h3>Our History</h3>
			</section>
			<section class="our-history-paragraph clearfix">
				<p>The Japanese Women's Leadership Initiative (JWLI) was founded in 2006 by three visionary women in Boston,
					Massachusetts: Atsuko Toko Fish, Mary Lassen, and Catherine Crone Coburn. JWLI brings emerging women leaders,
					referred to as the Fellows, from Japan to Boston to receive four weeks of hands on experience and training
					with
					successful nonprofit organizations in nonprofit management and leadership development. During their stay in
					Boston, the Fellows will develop an Action Plan, which will serve as a step-by-step roadmap to make their
					dreams
					of social change a reality. After returning to Japan, the Fellows are expected to make a difference in their
					communities based on their Action Plans. The purpose of this program is for the fellows to share the knowledge
					and
					experience they acquired in Boston with other women and social dector leaders within <span
						class="break">Japan.</span>

					The Fish Family Founation, operating in conjunction with other Boston-based nonprofit organizations, is
					administering JWLI in partnership with Simmons College School of Management's Center for Gender in
					<span class="break">Organizations.</span>

					In 2010, thanks to generous funding provided by the U.S-Japan Foundation, JWLI expanded its vision to hold
					public
					forums within Japan. Held in 2010, 2012, and 2013, these public forums provided information about the
					nonprofit
					sector and the American approach to philanthropy with hopes to inspire women to take leadership roles. The
					Forum
					Program reached hundreds of Japanese citizens, advocating for their involvement in addressing the needs of
					Japanese society.
